# Sentence_Parser
 The assignment asks to describe, design and implement in software a parser for Regular Expressions  using the programming language of your choice. The parser should take input and then analyse a set  of Regular Expressions, the selection we got to do was: The/a boy/boys/girl/girls bite(s)/like(s) the white cat. The input sentence should be parsed to be accepted or rejected as a valid Regular Expression. The  output should be bracketed phrasal structure for the sentence for as far as it is grammatical. It  should also output an appropriate parse tree displaying the sentence structure similar to below but  suited to your inputted regular expression. I choose this program to work on python because I am more knowledgeable when it comes to using  python rather than java.
